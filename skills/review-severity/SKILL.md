description: 'Shared severity taxonomy, blocking rule, and report template used by any domain-specific review skill.'
---

## Purpose

Provides the severity classification, ordering, and outcome rules shared by every review skill in this
repository, so each domain-specific skill (e.g. `skill/code-review`<!-- skill-ref: ignore -->, `skill/ai-component-review`<!-- skill-ref: ignore -->) defines only
what it checks, not how findings are ranked or reported. A domain skill gathers findings through its own
steps, then hands them to this skill to classify, order, and render into a Review Report.

Use this skill whenever an agent needs to classify review findings by severity and produce a Review Report —
never redefine the severity table or blocking rule locally.

---

## Inputs

- **Findings** — issues gathered by the invoking skill's own domain-specific steps
- **Subject reference** — the Plan ID, ADR, or diff being reviewed
- **Reviewer** — the agent performing the review
- **Dimensions** — the list of review dimensions the invoking skill checked, which become the Coverage rows
- **Iteration** — the review round, 1 for a first review
- **Acceptance criteria, if any** — the criteria the governing plan enumerates
- **Prior Review Report, if a re-review** — the reviewer's own report from the previous round (the same reviewer is reused across rounds, so it already holds it)

---

## Steps

### Step 1 — Classify each finding

| Severity | Meaning                                                                                    |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| CRITICAL | Security vulnerability, data loss risk, broken builds                                      |
| HIGH     | Security/logging requirement unmet, major standards violation, acceptance criterion missed |
| MEDIUM   | Standards violation not affecting correctness, missing docs                                |
| LOW      | Style inconsistency, minor naming deviation                                                |

A domain skill's own steps may name additional situations that are always HIGH-or-above (e.g.
`skill/ai-component-review`<!-- skill-ref: ignore -->'s rule on `tools`/`approved_tools`/`blocked_commands` diffs) — those are
constraints on which bucket a finding falls into, not a different taxonomy.

### Step 2 — Determine the outcome

Any CRITICAL, HIGH, or MEDIUM finding blocks approval and must be fixed. Outcome is **APPROVED** only when
zero CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM findings remain; otherwise **NEEDS_CHANGES**. This is the review stopping rule: the
reviewer stops and approves once nothing at MEDIUM or above remains.

LOW findings never block. They go to the report's LOW Backlog (Step 4) and are fixed only if the human asks. A
re-review never re-raises a LOW backlog item as blocking, and an iteration is never spent on LOW findings alone.

### Step 3 — Write each finding to be actionable

Every finding states: what is wrong, what rule or requirement it violates, and what must be done to resolve
it. A finding missing any of the three is not yet ready to report — go back and fill in the gap.

### Step 4 — Order and render the report

Order findings CRITICAL → HIGH → MEDIUM → LOW. Number each finding with a zero-based index that runs once
across the whole report, in that order, and prefix it with the finding's severity in the heading (e.g.
`MEDIUM-0`, `MEDIUM-1`, `LOW-2`) so any finding can be referenced unambiguously. Render using the template at
`skills/review-severity/reference/template.md`, filling its sections as follows:

- **Coverage** — one row per input dimension. Status is `Pass` (checked, no findings), `Findings` (checked, list the finding IDs), or `N/A` (does not apply to this diff). Never omit a dimension; an omitted row is indistinguishable from an unchecked one.
- **Category** — every finding names the Coverage dimension(s) it falls under, comma-separated when it spans more than one. A finding's ID appears in the Coverage row of every dimension it names.
- **Acceptance Criteria** — include only when criteria were supplied; one row per criterion, `Met` or `Unmet`. An `Unmet` criterion also needs a finding.
- **Prior Findings** — include only when Iteration is above 1; one row per finding in the prior report, `Resolved`, `Not resolved`, or `Regressed`. A finding that is not `Resolved` is reported again as a current finding, so it is counted in Outcome.
- **LOW Backlog** — LOW findings are listed here, not under Findings, in the same ID order and still carrying the three required parts (Step 3). Omit the section when there are none.
- Omit a conditional section entirely rather than leaving an empty heading — the whole report is posted as one PR review, so an empty section is noise.

### Step 5 — Never expand scope

A review produces findings against existing requirements only. Never suggest features or scope expansions as
findings — that judgment belongs elsewhere (the human, or whoever owns the plan).

---

## Outputs

- **Review Report** — markdown following the shared template
- **Outcome:** APPROVED (no CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM) or NEEDS_CHANGES (has CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM findings)

---

## Edge Cases

- **No findings at all** — still produce the report with outcome APPROVED and a brief summary of what was
  reviewed.
- **Re-review but the prior report is unavailable** — omit Prior Findings and say so in the Summary rather than guessing at the earlier findings.
- **Finding interacts with another finding** — note the relationship. Fixing one may resolve or change the
  other.
- **A rule conflicts with the plan being reviewed against** — raise it as a finding citing both references.
  Do not silently pick one.
- **Domain skill flags a situation as always HIGH-or-above** — honor that floor even if this skill's own
  table would otherwise classify it lower.
