## Purpose

Reviews source code against its governing plan, language standards, and project standards.
Produces a structured report that either approves the code or returns it with actionable findings for correction.

---

## Inputs

- **Source code** — files to review
- **Iteration** — the review round, 1 for a first review; on a re-review the reviewer's own prior Review Report is the baseline for Prior Findings
- **Governing plan** — what was supposed to be built (acceptance criteria, security, logging): the Feature Plan for Task work decomposed from one, a Tier 3 plan for standalone work that rose to Tier 3, or — for standalone Tier 1/2 work, which has no separate plan artifact by default — the task description and any outline produced per `skill/complexity-tiers`, if one exists
- **Language standards** — from `standards/{stack}.md`
- **Project standards** — from `projects/{name}/project-standards.md`

## Steps

### Step 1 — Review Completeness

Verify every component in the plan's component list exists. Missing components are CRITICAL findings before any code quality review begins.

### Step 2 — Review Change Scope

- If the diff's author is Architect or Engineering Researcher, confirm every touched path stays within that agent's own documented write scope (`agents/architect.yaml`'s Hard rules, `agents/engineering-researcher.yaml`'s Hard rules). A path outside that scope is a HIGH finding, the same severity class as `skill/ai-component-review`'s `tools`/`approved_tools`/`blocked_commands` rule.
- If the diff adds a file under a directory an arc42 section already describes, confirm that section's building-block table and `key_files` were updated to include it, per `steering/global/knowledge-consumption.md`'s Doc-Update Acceptance Gate. A missing update is a MEDIUM finding.

### Step 3 — Review Security and Logging

Go through security and logging requirements line by line. Each unmet requirement is a finding classified HIGH or CRITICAL.

### Step 4 — Review Standards Compliance

Check naming conventions, file headers (including the Plan ID reference), doc comments, async patterns, error handling, and any other rules in the active standards files.

### Step 5 — Review Logic and Correctness

Does the implementation match the plan's described behaviour? Are edge cases handled?
Are interfaces implemented as specified? Does the Test Results Report cover every test case the plan's Testing Plan defines, with none skipped unflagged?

### Step 6 — Produce Review Report

Hand the findings gathered in Steps 1-5 to `skill/review-severity` for severity classification, ordering, and
the report itself — this skill defines what to check, not how findings are ranked or rendered. Pass these as the
report's review dimensions, one per step above, in this order: Completeness, Change scope, Security and logging,
Standards compliance, Logic and correctness. Also pass the review's Iteration, the plan's acceptance criteria
when it enumerates them, and the prior Review Report when this is a re-review.

## Outputs

- **Review Report** — produced per `skill/review-severity`
- **Outcome:** APPROVED or NEEDS_CHANGES, per `skill/review-severity`

---

## Edge Cases

See `skill/review-severity` for severity/reporting edge cases. Code-review-specific:

- **A missing component overlaps a standards violation** — report the missing-component finding (Step 1);
  don't also flag the standards rules it would have needed to follow.
