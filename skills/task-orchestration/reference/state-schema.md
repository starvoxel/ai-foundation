# Orchestration State Schema

The orchestrating agent maintains an orchestration state file throughout execution.
This is the single source of truth for Task pipeline status, wave progression,
escalations, and the coordination work log.

Start from the template at `skills/task-orchestration/assets/orchestration-state.json`.

## Location

```
{paths.orchestration}/{FeatureID}/orchestration-state.json

Resolved from `.aiconfig.json` at project root. Default: `plans/orchestration/`.

| `log`          | array  | Yes      | Chronological work log entries                       |

### Task state object

| Field            | Type         | Required | Description                                              |

| `wave`           | number       | Yes      | Which wave this Task belongs to (0-based)                |
| `status`         | string       | Yes      | Current status (see transitions below)                   |

| `blocked_reason` | string\|null | Yes      | Null when not blocked, reason string when blocked        |

There is no `agents` field — every Task is owned end-to-end by one implementing
agent (Software-Engineer today; see `docs/process-model.md`'s Agent roster). Re-add a
selector field only if a second implementing agent role is ever introduced.

### Task status values

| Status         | Meaning                                          |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `Ready`        | Dependencies satisfied, waiting for dispatch     |
| `Implementing` | The implementing agent is working                |
| `Reviewing`    | The review agent is reviewing                    |
| `Done`         | Approved and complete                            |
| `Conflict`     | Merge conflict detected — resolution in progress |
| `Blocked`      | Cannot proceed — see `blocked_reason`            |

### Status transitions

```
Ready → Implementing → Reviewing → Done
                            │
                            ▼
                    Implementing (review loop, iterations++)

Any pipeline status → Conflict (when merge conflict detected)
Conflict → Implementing (when resolved — pipeline restarts, iterations reset to 0)
Conflict → Blocked (when the implementing agent cannot resolve — human intervention needed)

Any status → Blocked (with reason)
Blocked → Ready (when human unblocks)
```

- Maximum 5 iterations through the review loop before escalation.
- A Task may be blocked at any point (e.g., requires out-of-domain work, merge conflict, human input needed).
- When a conflict is resolved, the pipeline restarts from Implementing with iterations reset. This ensures tests and review validate the post-resolution code.
- A Task's PR is opened once, as a draft, when it first reaches `Implementing` and the implementing agent completes its first pass — not after `Reviewing` approves. `Reviewing` → `Done` marks that same PR ready-for-review; it never opens a second one.

## Rules

- The orchestration state file is updated after every status transition.
- Log entries are append-only — never delete or modify past entries.
- Only the orchestrating agent writes to this file.
- The `current_wave` only advances when all non-blocked Tasks in the wave are `Done`.
- Overall `status` is `Blocked` if all remaining Tasks are blocked and no progress can be made.
- Overall `status` is `Complete` when all Tasks are `Done`.
