## Problem Statement

The Decision Record system (`skill/decision-record`) has one format, one weight
class, and one implicit author (Architect in practice) for every decision,
regardless of subject matter. This causes two concrete problems, observed directly
in this repo's 11 existing records:

1. **Narrow scope, forced ceremony.** Decisions that are not architectural
   (process/orchestration design, planning-artifact conventions, worklog structure)
   go through the same full options-exploration template as genuine
   multi-component architectural trade-offs, because there is no lighter-weight
   home for them.
2. **Interconnectivity is manual prose, not structure.** Cross-references
   (`Referenced By`, `References`, `Supersedes`) are free-text fields typed by hand
   into a metadata table. There is no index, no registry, and no validation that a
   reference is bidirectional or that a referenced ID still exists. Discovering
   "what decisions exist" means listing a directory; discovering "what does this
   decision affect" means grep-and-read across a growing file set. This has already
   surfaced in practice — a later decision needed to reconsider an earlier one's
   authorship assumption with no structural link to do so, only a manually-written
   open question.

Additionally, decision-authorship has so far defaulted to Architect for
process/orchestration decisions (AIF-005, AIF-006, AIF-009, AIF-010) that are not
architectural in nature — they are about how work is dispatched, isolated, and
sequenced, which is Engineering-Manager's operating domain, not Architect's.
Continuing to route every non-code decision through Architect (or, worse, through
Tech-Lead as a catch-all) misassigns decisions away from the agent with the
standing operational context to actually evaluate them.

---

## Constraints & Requirements

What was non-negotiable:
- Must not weaken `skill/plan-lifecycle`'s human-approval gate for any decision,
  regardless of tier or domain.
- Must not make Tech-Lead a catch-all owner for "everything non-architectural" —
  its charter is Epic/Chunk decomposition, not decision research.
- Must not silently widen web-search/fetch access across every agent that gains
  decision-authoring capability — tool grants stay tied to demonstrated need, not
  to "might need to research something someday."
- Must preserve global uniqueness of decision IDs across every project repo this
  framework is installed into (this repo is a framework other project repos
  install from — a bare domain-only ID scheme would collide across projects).

What was a preference but not a hard requirement:
- Reuse existing infrastructure (`knowledge/index.json`, the `scope` field already
  defined in `skill/knowledge-authoring`) rather than inventing a second, parallel
  discovery mechanism.
- Keep the migration cost for this repo's existing 11 records low where possible
  (favor renumbering `Draft` records over already-`Approved` ones when the two are
  otherwise equivalent).

## Options Explored

### Option A: Status quo — single format, single implicit author, single ID/location scheme

**Summary**: Keep `skill/decision-record` exactly as it is: one full
options-exploration template for every decision, Architect as the de facto author
regardless of subject matter, `{ProjectID}-{###}` IDs in a single flat
`docs/decisions/` folder, and every record treated identically for
`knowledge/index.json` consumption.

**Strengths**: Nothing to build. One template to maintain. One place to look.

**Weaknesses**: Directly causes both problems in the Problem Statement. Forces
process/orchestration and planning-convention decisions through architecture-grade
ceremony. Provides no structural interconnectivity — cross-references remain
free-text and unvalidated. Concentrates decision-authorship in Architect for
domains (orchestration, worktree isolation, git workflow mode) it has no
particular standing expertise in, while Tech-Lead absorbs everything else by
default, overloading a decomposition-focused agent with decision-research work.

**Verdict**: Not chosen — this is the system generating the problem, not a
solution to it.

### Option B: Tier-only split — scale format to weight, keep single author and single ID/location scheme

**Summary**: Introduce rigor tiers (full options-exploration format for
significant decisions, a slim format for lighter ones, inline recording for
trivial ones) and a shared index for interconnectivity, but keep Architect as the
sole author of every Tier A/B decision and a single flat `docs/decisions/` folder
with one shared `{ProjectID}-{###}` counter.

**Strengths**: Fixes the ceremony-mismatch problem. Fixes interconnectivity via an
index. Smallest change from today's system that still solves both stated
problems.

**Weaknesses**: Does not fix authorship. Architect remains responsible for
process/orchestration decisions outside its domain, and Tech-Lead remains the
implicit catch-all for everything else — the exact overload problem flagged
during design review. A single ID/location scheme still mixes decisions with
fundamentally different audiences (an implementer working inside
`chunk-orchestration` has to search a general architecture-decisions folder to
find the process decision that shaped it).

**Verdict**: Not chosen — solves half the problem while leaving the authorship
mismatch, which was the more consequential issue, unaddressed.

### Option C: Tier × Domain model — rigor and subject-matter ownership as independent axes (chosen)

**Summary**: Two independent axes govern every decision:

- **Tier** (rigor/format): how much options-exploration ceremony the decision
  needs, independent of subject matter.
- **Domain** (subject matter / ownership): which part of the system the decision
  concerns, which determines both the authoring agent and the template guidance
  for that decision's flexible sections.

Each domain gets its own ID counter/prefix and its own storage subfolder; a single
cross-domain `index.json` ties every Tier A/B decision together regardless of
physical location, for traceability and reference-graph validation. A promotion
threshold keeps decisions that don't need independent discoverability out of the
store entirely (recorded inline in the artifact that made them instead). Domains
mirror agents' actual operating areas — architecture to Architect,
process/orchestration to Engineering-Manager (an intentional charter expansion),
planning-artifact conventions to Tech-Lead, AI-component decisions to AI-Engineer
(existing precedent, AIF-004), quality-gate decisions to Principal-Engineer,
test-strategy to Test-Engineer, and meta-process decisions (decisions about the
decision-system itself, including this one) to a generic agent for now, with
"Project-Manager" reserved as the name for a future purpose-built agent if that
becomes warranted.

**Strengths**: Matches ceremony to actual decision weight (Tier) independently of
matching authorship to actual domain expertise (Domain) — the two problems this
repo hit (forced ceremony on small decisions, and misassigned authorship on
process decisions) are genuinely orthogonal and this is the only option that
treats them as such. Reuses the AIF-004 domain-split precedent rather than
inventing a new authorship model from scratch. Keeps per-domain IDs meaningful and
uncluttered (an Architecture decision's number reflects Architecture decision
volume, not process-decision noise). Keeps `knowledge/index.json` consumption
scoped to domains that genuinely lack a single canonical implementing artifact
(Architecture, AI-component) rather than loading every decision as if it were.

**Weaknesses**: More moving parts than Option B — multiple domain folders and ID
counters instead of one, a new lightweight Tier B artifact type, a documented Tier
C inline-recording convention, and a charter expansion for Engineering-Manager.
Existing records AIF-001 through AIF-011 need a one-time migration to the new
domain/ID/location scheme (see Impact on Planning).

**Verdict**: Chosen.

---

## Decision

**Chosen approach**: Option C — Tier × Domain model, with per-domain ID/location
scoping and a single cross-domain index for interconnectivity.

**Rationale**:
The two problems motivating this decision are independent: ceremony mismatch is a
question of *how much rigor a decision needs*, while authorship mismatch is a
question of *who has standing context to evaluate it*. Option B's single-author
assumption reproduces the authorship problem it was meant to help fix, just with
better formatting. Option C is the only option that lets both axes vary
independently, and it does so by extending a pattern this repo has already
validated once (AIF-004's AI-Engineer/Software-Engineer split) to the rest of the
agent roster rather than inventing new authorship logic from scratch. Restricting
`knowledge/index.json` consumption to domains without a canonical implementing
artifact (Architecture, AI-component) follows directly from how this repo's
`knowledge-authoring` skill already distinguishes prescriptive material (belongs
in standards/steering, loaded because it constrains future work directly) from
descriptive reference (belongs in knowledge) — a Process, Planning,
Quality-gate, or Test-strategy decision's real effect lives entirely in the
skill/template/steering file it changed, which agents already consult; a second,
driftable knowledge copy adds no information a decision's implementing artifact
doesn't already carry.

**Trade-offs accepted**:
- Six domain subfolders and counters (Architecture, Process, Planning,
  AI-component, Quality, Testing) plus a meta-process bucket, instead of one flat
  folder and counter. Judged acceptable because per-domain discoverability was the
  explicit goal, not an incidental cost.
- Engineering-Manager's charter expands to include decision-authoring, a real
  capability it does not have today (no options-exploration mode in its current
  prompt/skill surface). This is deliberate, not incidental scope creep — it is
  the direct fix for the authorship-mismatch problem.
- Existing records AIF-001 through AIF-011 require a one-time migration (new ID,
  new folder, updated cross-references). See Impact on Planning for the full
  table and sequencing recommendation.
- No domain owner receives `WebSearch`/`WebFetch` by default beyond what Architect
  already has, even though several new agents can now author Tier A/B decisions.
  If a specific future decision genuinely cannot be reasoned about from operating
  knowledge alone, that is evaluated per-agent at that time, not granted
  preemptively to every decision-authoring agent.

## Design

### Tier definitions (rigor axis, independent of domain)

| Tier | Format | Gate |
|---|---|---|
| **A — Researched** | Full options-exploration skeleton: Metadata, Problem Statement, Constraints, Options Explored (2-4 genuinely distinct options with strengths/weaknesses/verdict), Decision, optional Design, Impact on Planning, Resolved/Open Items. `Design` and `Impact on Planning` content is shaped by domain-specific guidance (see Domain table) rather than a forked template. | Full `plan-lifecycle` cycle: Draft → any number of revision commits → Approved (or Deferred), each its own commit. |
| **B — Structural** | Slim skeleton: Metadata (including Tier/Domain), Problem, Decision, Rationale, Impact. No Options-Explored ceremony. | Lighter one-shot confirmation — Draft committed, human confirms, Approved committed. No expectation of a multi-round revision cycle, though one may still happen if needed. |
| **C — Embedded** | No standalone artifact. Recorded inline in the governing plan's own body or its sibling worklog file (per AIF-011's worklog-split convention, once migrated — see below), using a short "Decision: ... **Why:** ..." convention. | Rides the governing plan's own `plan-lifecycle` gate. Nothing separate. |

**Promotion threshold** (Tier C is the default for any decision made during
planning or implementation):
1. Genuine trade-off between 2+ viable approaches with lasting cross-component
   impact → **Tier A**.
2. Else, can you name a plausible second, currently-unwritten piece of work that
   will need to cite this decision independently of the plan that made it? →
   **Tier B**.
3. Else → **Tier C**.
4. **Retroactive promotion**: if a Tier C decision is later cited by a second,
   unrelated plan, promote it — move its content into a proper Tier B (or A, if
   warranted) entry, assign it an ID, add it to the index — rather than letting
   the second plan re-explain it inline.

### Domain ownership (subject-matter axis, independent of tier)

| Domain | Code | Owner | Template guidance for Design/Impact on Planning | `knowledge/index.json`? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Architecture | `ARCH` | Architect | Schemas, component boundaries, system-structure diagrams | Yes — scope `all` or close to it |
| Process/orchestration | `PROC` | Engineering-Manager *(charter expansion)* | Dispatch/pipeline flow changes, orchestration-state effects | No — implemented effect lives in `chunk-orchestration`/`worktree-management`/git-workflow steering directly |
| Planning-artifact conventions | `PLAN` | Tech-Lead | Chunk/Epic Plan shape, worklog structure, plan-lifecycle mechanics | No — implemented effect lives in the relevant plan template |
| AI-component/declarative-system | `AIC` | AI-Engineer *(existing precedent, AIF-004)* | Agent/skill/steering/schema impact | Yes — scoped to AI-Engineer + adjacent authoring skills |
| Quality-gate/review-process | `QA` | Principal-Engineer | Review-criteria and severity-gate changes | No — implemented effect lives in the review skill/template |
| Test-strategy | `TEST` | Test-Engineer | Test-execution/coverage-strategy changes | No — implemented effect lives in the test-execution skill |
| *(none — intentional)* | — | Software-Engineer | — | Tech-Lead's Epic/Chunk process already covers Software-Engineer's decision needs |
| Meta-process (decisions about the decision-system itself) | `META` | Generic/catch-all agent for now; reserve **Project-Manager** as the name for a future dedicated agent | Effect on `skill/decision-record` and related skills/steering | No |

No domain owner is granted `WebSearch`/`WebFetch` solely to support
decision-authoring.

### ID and storage scheme

`{ProjectID}-{DomainCode}-{###}`, e.g. `AIF-ARCH-004`, `AIF-PROC-002`. Counter is
scoped per `(project, domain)` pair — independent across both projects and
domains, so no domain's numbering is diluted by unrelated activity elsewhere, and
no two projects installing this framework can collide on an ID.

Location: `{paths.decisions}/{domain-folder}/{ID}_{ShortTitle}.decision.md`, where
`domain-folder` is the lowercase domain name (`architecture/`, `process/`,
`planning/`, `ai-component/`, `quality/`, `testing/`, `meta-process/`). Tier C
decisions are never stored here — they live inline per the Tier table above.

### Cross-domain index (`docs/decisions/index.json`)

One entry per Tier A/B decision, regardless of domain folder:

```json
{
  "id": "AIF-PROC-002",
  "tier": "A",
  "domain": "process",
  "title": "AI-Track Chunk Orchestration Dispatch",
  "status": "Approved",
  "path": "docs/decisions/process/AIF-PROC-002_ai-track-orchestration-dispatch.decision.md",
  "supersedes": [],
  "superseded_by": [],
  "references": ["AIF-PROC-001"],
  "referenced_by": ["AIF-PROC-004", "AIF-PROC-005", "AIF-PROC-006"],
  "tags": ["orchestration", "dispatch"]
}
```

Whichever skill produces or updates a Tier A/B record updates `index.json` in the
same commit — a required output step, not a separate manual chore. A validation
step (extending existing test tooling rather than adding a standalone script)
checks that every `references`/`referenced_by` pair is bidirectional and every
`path` resolves.

---

## Impact on Planning

What Tech-Lead must know when decomposing the Epic that implements this decision:

**Skills/files requiring edits:**
- `skills/decision-record/` — scope explicitly to Tier A; add `Tier`/`Domain`
  metadata fields; add "update `index.json`" as a required Output step; add
  per-domain guidance stubs for `Design`/`Impact on Planning` content.
- New skill (or extension of `skills/knowledge-authoring`) for Tier B — slim
  template, same `Tier`/`Domain` fields, same index-update requirement, lighter
  gate per the Tier table.
- `skills/plan-lifecycle/` — document the Tier B abbreviated gate; reference the
  index-update step; document that Tier C rides its parent plan's gate.
- `skills/chunk-planning/` and `skills/epic-planning/` templates — add the Tier C
  inline-recording convention as documented guidance, not an implicit assumption.
- `agents/engineering-manager.yaml` — charter expansion to include
  decision-authoring (Process domain), following the pattern already used for
  AI-Engineer's Architecture/AI-component split.
- `skills/knowledge-authoring/` — update Step 2's `decision` type guidance to
  reflect the domain-scoped `knowledge/index.json` rule (Architecture/AI-component
  only) instead of a blanket "use decision-record instead."
- One-time creation of `docs/decisions/index.json`, backfilled from the 11
  existing records per the migration table below.

**Migration of existing records (AIF-001 through AIF-011):**

| Old ID | Title | Status | New Domain | New ID | New Folder | `knowledge/index.json`? | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| AIF-001 | Install CLI Redesign | Approved | Architecture | `AIF-ARCH-001` | `architecture/` | Yes | |
| AIF-002 | Steering Schema & Harness Adapter Scoping | Approved | Architecture | `AIF-ARCH-002` | `architecture/` | Yes | `Referenced By: AIF-001` → update to `AIF-ARCH-001` |
| AIF-003 | Shared Resource Lifecycle Management | Approved | Architecture | `AIF-ARCH-003` | `architecture/` | Yes | Originally authored by AI-Engineer, predating the AIF-004 boundary and this domain-ownership model. Historical inconsistency — no retroactive re-authorship, note only. |
| AIF-004 | AI-Engineer/Software-Engineer Boundary | Approved | Process | `AIF-PROC-001` | `process/` | No | `Referenced By: AIF-005, AIF-007, AIF-009` → update IDs |
| AIF-005 | AI-Track Chunk Orchestration Dispatch | Approved | Process | `AIF-PROC-002` | `process/` | No | References/Referenced By set needs updating (AIF-004, AIF-007, AIF-009, AIF-010) |
| AIF-006 | Parallel Chunk Isolation (Worktrees) | Draft | Process | `AIF-PROC-003` | `process/` | No | Still Draft — cheapest of the batch to renumber |
| AIF-007 | Standards Sync Ownership | Draft | Process | `AIF-PROC-004` | `process/` | No | Still Draft |
| AIF-008 | Standards Sync Mechanism | Draft | **Architecture** | `AIF-ARCH-004` | `architecture/` | Yes | Reclassified — this is concrete mechanism/system design (sync protocol, conflict handling, config schema), not process/orchestration, despite sitting numerically inside the 004–011 cluster |
| AIF-009 | Git Workflow Mode | Draft | Process | `AIF-PROC-005` | `process/` | No | Still Draft |
| AIF-010 | Who Sets AI-Track Chunk Boundaries | Approved | Process | `AIF-PROC-006` | `process/` | No | Borderline Process/Planning — classified Process because it concerns `chunks.json`/orchestration authorship, not artifact shape |
| AIF-011 | Epic/Chunk Colocation, Worklog Split | Approved | Planning | `AIF-PLAN-001` | `planning/` | No | |

Sequencing recommendation: migrate the four still-`Draft` records (AIF-006,
AIF-007, AIF-008, AIF-009) first — cheapest, since no downstream work has been
built against their current IDs yet. Migrate the seven `Approved` records
afterward, and as part of that pass, grep the repo for each old ID string
(`AIF-001` through `AIF-011`) to catch any prose reference outside the
`docs/decisions/` tree itself (commit messages are historical and are not
rewritten; live documentation and skills are).

**Not required by this decision:**
- No `.aiconfig.json` path changes beyond adding the domain subfolders under the
  existing `paths.decisions` (or its equivalent) resolution.
- No change to `plan-lifecycle`'s core Draft → Approved mechanics — only which
  artifacts use the full cycle versus the Tier B abbreviated one.

## Resolved Items

| # | Item | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Should ceremony scale independently of who owns a decision? | Yes — Tier (rigor) and Domain (ownership) are independent axes, not a single combined classification. |
| 2 | Who owns process/orchestration decisions? | Engineering-Manager, via a deliberate charter expansion — not Architect, and not Tech-Lead as a catch-all. |
| 3 | Who owns planning-artifact-convention decisions? | Tech-Lead, narrowly scoped to the shape of its own output artifacts — not "everything non-architectural." |
| 4 | Does Software-Engineer need its own decision domain? | No — intentional. Tech-Lead's Epic/Chunk process already covers Software-Engineer's decision needs. |
| 5 | Who owns meta-process decisions (decisions about the decision-system itself, including this one)? | A generic/catch-all agent for now. "Project-Manager" is reserved as the name for a future purpose-built agent if that becomes warranted. |
| 6 | Should every domain-owning agent gain research tools (`WebSearch`/`WebFetch`)? | No — none are added by default. Widening web access across every decision-authoring agent was judged a real security-surface cost for a benefit not yet demonstrated. Revisit per-agent only if a specific decision genuinely requires it. |
| 7 | Should decision IDs be domain-only (e.g. `PROC-002`), or retain the project prefix? | Retain the project prefix — `{ProjectID}-{DomainCode}-{###}`. This repo is a framework other project repos install from; a domain-only prefix would collide across projects. |
| 8 | Should every decision live in the same folder with the same naming convention? | No — each domain gets its own subfolder and its own `(project, domain)`-scoped ID counter. A single cross-domain `index.json` provides unified discoverability without requiring uniform physical location. |
| 9 | Should all Decision Records be loaded via `knowledge/index.json`? | No — only Architecture and AI-component, the two domains without a single canonical implementing artifact that already captures the decision's effect. The other domains' decisions are traceable via `index.json` for history/audit, but not proactively loaded — their implemented effect already lives in the skill/template/steering file agents consult directly. |
| 10 | What domain do AIF-004 through AIF-011 fall under? | See the migration table above. Ten of the eleven existing records fall into Architecture (4) or Process (6); one (AIF-011) falls into Planning. |
