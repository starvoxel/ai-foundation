description: "Shared commit-gate procedure and status vocabulary for any artifact requiring human approval before dependent work begins."
---

## Purpose

Defines, in one place, how a human-approval-gated artifact (Chunk Plan, Epic Plan,
Decision Record, or a Tier 3 `ai-engineering-plan`) moves from first draft to a state
that other work is allowed to depend on. Other planning skills reference this skill
instead of restating the procedure.

Use this skill whenever a skill produces an artifact with a `Status` field that a
human must approve before implementation, decomposition, or any other dependent work
may proceed.

---

## Inputs

- **Artifact file path** — where the plan/record lives (per the producing skill's
  `Outputs` section and the project's `.aiconfig.json` `paths.*` configuration)
- **Artifact type** — Chunk Plan, Epic Plan, Decision Record, or Tier 3 plan (determines
  which status values from `reference/status-vocabulary.md` are valid)
- **Current lifecycle stage** — first draft, a revision round, or a final human decision

---

## Steps

### Step 1 — Save as Draft and commit

Write the artifact to its configured path with `Status: Draft` and, where the template
has one, `Approved by: Pending` (or the artifact's equivalent field). Commit it via
`ai-git` before presenting it to the human. A plan that only exists in chat is not a
plan for the purposes of any steering rule that requires "an approved plan."

### Step 2 — Present for review

Present the artifact to the human for feedback. Do not begin implementation,
decomposition, or any dependent work while status is `Draft`.

### Step 3 — Commit each revision

If the human requests changes, edit the artifact and commit again as a new commit
(never amend, never squash the history of a plan under review). Status remains
`Draft` through as many revision rounds as needed. Each revision's commit message
should make clear it is a plan revision (e.g. "Revise plan: ...").

### Step 4 — Commit the human's decision

Once the human gives an explicit decision, update the `Status` field and commit that
change as its own commit, separate from any implementation:

- **Approved** — the human explicitly confirmed. This is the only status that
  satisfies an "approved plan" gate elsewhere in steering. Update the approver field
  (e.g. `Approved by: {name}`) in the same commit.
  If the artifact type is a Decision Record, `Superseded` (from
  `reference/status-vocabulary.md`) is a state the record moves to later, not a
  decision made at this step.
- **Deferred** — the human explicitly chose to postpone. This is not an approval;
  see Edge Cases.

Verbal or chat-only confirmation never satisfies the gate — only the committed
`Approved` status does.

### Step 5 — Mark Done when the described work completes

When the work the artifact describes is finished (implementation merged, decision
fully acted on, etc.), update `Status: Done` and commit. This is informational —
it is not itself a gate for anything downstream, but it keeps the artifact's
status accurate for future readers.

---

## Outputs

- A committed artifact whose `Status` field accurately reflects `Draft`, `Approved`,
  `Done`, `Deferred`, or (Decision Records only) `Superseded` at all times — see
  `reference/status-vocabulary.md`.
- A git history that shows the full Draft → revision → revision → Approved (or
  Deferred) progression as separate commits.

---

## Edge Cases

- **Human says "just do it" / approves verbally in chat only** — still requires the
  committed `Approved` status update before implementation starts. Do the commit
  first, then proceed.
- **Human wants to defer rather than approve or reject** — set `Status: Deferred`
  and commit. A `Deferred` artifact is not approved; nothing may treat it as
  satisfying an approval gate. It can later be revisited (moved back to `Draft`) or
  approved directly from `Deferred`.
- **Checking whether a specific piece of dependent work may proceed** — check only
  for `Status: Approved` on the governing artifact. Do not add special-case handling
  for `Deferred`, `Draft`, or any other non-`Approved` value — the absence of
  `Approved` is sufficient by itself to block dependent work.
- **Repo has no `paths.plans` (or equivalent) configured in `.aiconfig.json`** —
  fall back to `docs/plans/` for Tier 3 plans; Chunk/Epic Plans and Decision Records
  use their own skills' documented path defaults.
- **Framework repo (direct commits to main)** — the commit gate still applies. There
  is no branch/PR step, but the Draft and Approved commits must still exist as
  separate, real commits on `main` before implementation commits follow.
