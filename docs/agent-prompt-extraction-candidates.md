description: "Prompt content that reads like a reusable rule/procedure but currently lives in only one agent's prompt — tracked so it can be promoted to a skill or steering rule if a second agent needs the same behavior."
---

## Purpose

Some content in an agent's prompt is genuinely agent-specific (identity, scope
boundaries, judgment calls unique to that role). Other content is a self-contained
procedure or rule that simply hasn't been extracted into a skill or steering file
yet — usually because only one agent currently needs it, and extracting on day one
would add an indirection layer with no reuse benefit (see
`skill/skill-authoring` Edge Cases: "unclear whether to use a script or prose
step" — the same "don't abstract prematurely" principle applies to skill
extraction).

This file is the record of that second category: things that *look* extractable
but aren't extracted *yet*, why, and the condition that should trigger extraction.
It exists so the decision not to extract is a tracked, revisitable choice — not a
silent one that gets rediscovered from scratch each time.

Checked and updated per `skill/agent-authoring` Step 5 whenever a prompt is written
or revised.

## How to use this file

- **Writing/revising a prompt:** if you're about to write a generic-sounding rule
  or procedure that isn't specific to the agent's identity, check this list first —
  it may already be tracked. If it's new, add an entry.
- **Adding a second agent that needs an existing entry's behavior:** that's the
  trigger condition. Extract the content into a skill or steering rule (per
  `skill/skill-authoring` or `skill/steering-authoring`), update both agents to
  reference it, and remove the entry from this file (or mark it resolved with the
  extraction's location).
- **This file is descriptive, not prescriptive.** Nothing here is enforced. It is
  a judgment aid, not a rule — see `steering/global/knowledge-consumption.md` for
  how descriptive knowledge differs from prescriptive standards.

## Current candidates

### Architect — Decision Record drafting constraint

**Where:** `agents/architect.yaml` Hard Rules — "Never set a Decision Record's
Status to 'Approved' or fill in 'Approved By'. Only a human may approve. Always
set Status to 'Draft' and Approved By to 'Pending'."

**Why not extracted:** This is a specific instance of the general commit-gate
principle already centralized in `skill/plan-lifecycle` (only a human-committed
`Approved` status satisfies the gate). Architect is currently the only agent that
*drafts* Decision Records, so the instruction to leave Status/Approved-By
unfilled has no second consumer yet.

**Extraction trigger:** A second agent is introduced that also drafts
human-approval-gated artifacts directly (not via an existing planning skill like
`epic-planning`/`chunk-planning`, which already encode this via
`skill/plan-lifecycle`). If that happens, promote this instruction into
`skill/plan-lifecycle` itself as an explicit "drafting agents never self-approve"
step, rather than repeating it per agent.

### Engineering-Tech-Writer — CHANGELOG entry format

**Where:** `agents/engineering-tech-writer.yaml` prompt — the
`## [{date}] {Plan ID} — {Title}` / `### Added / Changed / Fixed / Security`
format block.

**Why not extracted:** Engineering-Tech-Writer is currently the only
documentation-producing agent in the framework. The format is a small, fixed
template with no procedural steps around it, so a full skill folder would be
disproportionate for one consumer.

**Extraction trigger:** A second documentation-focused agent is introduced (e.g.
a product-docs or release-notes agent) that needs the same or a closely related
changelog format. At that point, promote to a lightweight skill (or an
`assets/changelog-template.md` under a new `skill/tech-writing` if more structure
accumulates) rather than each agent hand-rolling its own format.

### Engineering-Manager — chunk branch naming convention

**Where:** `agents/engineering-manager.yaml` Hard Rules — branch naming
`{epic-id}/{chunk-id}-{short-description}`.

**Why not extracted:** Currently only Engineering-Manager creates chunk branches;
the convention is already partially covered by `skill/worktree-management`
(which creates the worktree onto a branch this rule names), so extraction now
would split one convention across two thin fragments for a single consumer.

**Extraction trigger:** A second agent gains the ability to create chunk
branches directly (e.g. a future agent that manages conflict resolution or
partial re-dispatch independently). At that point, move the naming convention
itself into `skill/worktree-management` so branch-naming and worktree-creation
stay defined in one place.

### Test-Engineer — per-method test coverage rule

**Where:** `agents/test-engineer.yaml` Hard Rules — "Every public method must
have at least one happy-path and one failure/edge-case test."

**Why not extracted:** This reads less like an agent-identity trait and more
like a testing standard — but it's currently written as a hard rule specific to
Test-Engineer rather than living in `standards/` or
`steering/engineering/core.md`. It hasn't been promoted because Test-Engineer is
the only agent that writes tests, so there's no second consumer forcing the
question of where the canonical version should live.

**Extraction trigger:** Either (a) a second agent is introduced that writes
tests (e.g. a specialized test-migration or test-refactoring agent), or (b) the
rule needs to vary by language/stack, in which case it belongs in `standards/`
rather than a skill. Revisit at that point rather than promoting speculatively
now.
