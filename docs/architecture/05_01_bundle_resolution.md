> How `resolveBundle()` turns a `bundle.yaml` into the concrete set of
> agents/skills/steering/servers that get installed.

## Why this needs its own section

`resolver.js` is 353 lines implementing a multi-step algorithm with real
branching (domain auto-discovery vs. explicit lists vs. both), not a thin
pass-through like most of §5's other blocks — worth opening up on its own.

## Resolution flow

  Explicit --> Dedupe["dedupe() each of the four lists"]
  Dedupe --> Out["ResolvedBundle { name, version, description, agents, skills, steering, servers }"]
```

## Motivation for this decomposition

Each domain-discovery sub-step below is a single read against one source
directory (`agents/`, `steering/`, `servers/`), triggered by one specific
condition. Keeping them as separate functions — rather than one function doing
all four reads — is what makes each independently testable and lets
`resolveBundle` itself stay a thin, linear pipeline: load → validate → discover
→ append → dedupe.

## Pipeline stages

1. **Load** — read `{paths per SOURCE_DIRS.bundles}/{bundleName}/bundle.yaml`; throw if
   missing, empty, or invalid YAML.
2. **Validate shape** — a bundle must set `domain`, at least one non-empty explicit
   list, or both. Neither is a hard error (a bundle that resolves to nothing is
   almost certainly a mistake, not an intentional empty install).
3. **Domain auto-discovery** (only if `domain` is set) — see the internal building
   blocks below.
4. **Append explicit lists** — whatever `bundle.yaml` itself lists under
   `agents`/`skills`/`steering`/`servers` is concatenated onto whatever step 3
   discovered (both, not either/or, when a bundle sets both `domain` and explicit
   entries).
5. **Dedupe** — each of the four resulting lists is passed through `dedupe()`
   independently before being returned as the `ResolvedBundle`.

## Domain auto-discovery — internal building blocks

Private helper functions `discoverByDomain` calls, in this fixed order. None of
these are exported — they're internal to `resolver.js` (see Interface below for
what actually crosses the file's boundary).

| Function                   | Responsibility                                                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `findAgentsByDomain`       | Every `agents/*.yaml` (excluding `_template.yaml`) whose own `domain` field matches.                                                                                                    |
| `collectSkillsFromAgents`  | Union of `skill/*` entries across those matched agents' `skills` fields, de-prefixed via `parseSkillRef`.                                                                               |
| `collectSteering`          | `steering/global/**/*.md` plus `steering/{domain}/**/*.md`, via the shared recursive `collectMdFiles` walk.                                                                             |
| `resolveServersFromAgents` | Any `@server/tool`-format tool reference in a matched agent's `tools` list, parsed via `parseServerToolRef` — filtered to server names that actually have a directory under `servers/`. |

## Interface

| Export                                                  | Purpose                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `resolveBundle(bundleName, repoRoot)`                   | The entry point above — returns a `ResolvedBundle`.                                            |
| `parseSkillRef(ref)`                                    | `"skill/plan-lifecycle"` → `"plan-lifecycle"`; bare names pass through; empty string → `null`. |
| `parseServerToolRef(tool)`                              | Parses an agent's `@server/tool`-format tool entry into its server name.                       |
| `listStandards/Bundles/Servers/HookResources(repoRoot)` | Directory listings used by `aif list` — independent of bundle resolution itself.               |
| `dedupe(arr)`                                           | Order-preserving de-duplication, shared by all four resolved lists.                            |

## Consumers

`lib/commands/install.js` is the only caller of `resolveBundle()` itself; `list.js`
uses the standalone `list*` helpers. Neither harness adapter (`claude.js`/`kiro.js`)
calls into `resolver.js` directly — they receive an already-resolved component list
from `install.js` and only handle the transform/write step (§5.02).
