# Project Standards Template

> Copy this file to `projects/{ProjectName}/project-standards.md` and fill it in.

This file defines overrides and additions specific to one project.
It is composed on top of the universal schema and the language standards file.

## Project Identity

| Field              | Value                                                        |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Project Name       | {ProjectName}                                                |
| Organization       | {Organization}                                               |
| Language           | {Language}                                                   |
| Module ID          | {ModuleID}                                                   |
| Repository         | {Repository}                                                 |
| Created            | {YYYY-MM-DD}                                                 |

**Module ID** is the language-specific package or module identifier for this project.
Examples: npm scope (`@org/package`), Go module (`github.com/org/repo`), Rust crate name, Python package name, .NET root namespace (`Company.Project`), Java group ID (`com.company.project`).

Standards for this project are configured in `.aiconfig.json` under the `standards` field.

## Project-Specific Naming Conventions

Only list overrides or additions to the base standards file.
If the base standards file already covers it, do not repeat it here.

| Construct       | Convention  | Example | Reason for Override |
|-----------------|-------------|---------|---------------------|
| {construct}     | {rule}      | {ex}    | {why different}     |

---

## Project-Specific Folder Structure Additions

Only document additions or deviations from the base standards layout.

```
{ProjectName}/
└── {AdditionalFolder}/    ← Purpose: {why this exists}
```

---

## Project-Specific Dependencies

List the packages approved for this project.
The Coder agent must not add packages not listed here without a plan update.

| Package                      | Version  | Purpose                        |
|------------------------------|----------|--------------------------------|
| {PackageName}                | {x.y.z}  | {What it is used for}          |

---

## Project-Specific Security Rules

Add rules specific to this project's data sensitivity, user base, or domain.
These add to the universal and language-level security rules — they do not replace them.

- [ ] {Rule specific to this project}

---

## Project-Specific Logging Rules

| Event              | Level  | What is logged    | What is NOT logged |
|--------------------|--------|-------------------|--------------------|
| {project event}    | {level}| {safe fields}     | {excluded fields}  |

---

## Project-Specific Testing Rules

Any additions to the base testing standards — e.g. required integration test scenarios, specific data fixtures, or environment setup requirements.

---

## Known Constraints & Decisions

Technical decisions and constraints are stored in `knowledge/decisions/`.
Use the decision-record skill to create them.

---

## Out of Bounds

Explicit list of things that must never appear in this project's plans or code, regardless of what any agent reasons.

- {e.g. No external network calls without explicit plan approval}
- {e.g. No third-party analytics or telemetry}
- {e.g. No cloud storage of user data in v1}
