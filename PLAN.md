## Milestone Descriptions

### v0.1 — Framework Foundation ✅
Structure defined and validated. Agents, skills, steering, and tests exist as plain files.
Everything is portable and harness-agnostic.

### v1.0 — MVP
Agents load in a harness with steering applied. Install/deploy works with bundle
discovery, MCP server support, and snapshot-based freshness detection. The planning
flow works end-to-end on a real project. Knowledge system gives agents project context.
Standards cover common languages. Minimum needed to start using this for actual
development across multiple projects.

### v1.1 — Observability
Track what happened (Work Log), what's in progress (task tracking), catch
regressions automatically (CI/CD), and resume after interruptions.

### v1.2 — Quality Gates
Automated plan review, epic-level QA agents, and documentation generation reduce
the burden on human reviewers and keep docs current.

### v1.3 — Tooling
MCP servers give agents specialized capabilities: security scanning, code analysis,
and domain-specific operations beyond what the harness provides natively.

### v1.4 — Product Domain
Expand beyond engineering into product requirements, UX, and design feedback.

### v2.0 — Self-Improving
The system learns from outcomes, evolves prompts based on results, and builds
institutional memory across projects.
